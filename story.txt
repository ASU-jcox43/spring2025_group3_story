One day, I was driving 100 kmh over the speed limit in my Porsche. I really wanted to get brot from the bakery. But it was hot and the Klimaanlage in my Porsche wasn't blowing cold. So, I decided it was time to head over to the Biergarten to drink a cool one and relax. After kicking back with a cold one, I began to develop a craving for some Apfelkuchen. All of a sudden, a wild Mehlhase scurried towards my feet, so I began running!
